## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **OAuth Token Not Found:**

   - **Error Message:** `ValueError: OAuth token not found. Please set SOUNDCLOUD_OAUTH_TOKEN in your .env file.`
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the `.env` file exists in the project root and contains the `SOUNDCLOUD_OAUTH_TOKEN` variable with a valid token.

2. **Invalid Playlist ID or URL:**

   - **Error Message:** `Exception: Failed to resolve playlist URL: 404 - Not Found`
   - **Solution:** Verify that the playlist ID or URL entered is correct and that the playlist exists.

3. **API Rate Limits Exceeded:**

   - **Error Message:** `Exception: Failed to fetch playlist: 429 - Too Many Requests`
   - **Solution:** Wait for a while before retrying. Implement exponential backoff in the script for handling rate limits.

4. **Failed to Create Playlist:**

   - **Error Message:** `Exception: Failed to create playlist: 403 - Forbidden`
   - **Solution:** Check if the OAuth token has the necessary permissions. Ensure that the new playlist title is valid and doesn't violate SoundCloud's policies.

5. **Network Issues:**

   - **Error Message:** `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ...`
   - **Solution:** Verify your internet connection and ensure that SoundCloud's API is reachable.
